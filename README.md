# Dataset:
In two Excel files, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are available between 2017 and 2020. The columns of the Excel file include the date and price of opening and closing, as well as the highest and lowest rates of the day.


# Prediction phase:
The focus of this phase is on predicting the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For this purpose, I used the Linear regression technique.Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value. It mathematically models the unknown or dependent variable and the known or independent variable as a linear equation.Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. There are simple linear regression calculators that use a "least squares" method to discover the best-fit line for a set of paired data.
